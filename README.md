#  Markov Sentence Generator app
A Markov sentence generator is a type of algorithm used to generate sentences based on statistical patterns observed in a given corpus of text. The algorithm relies on Markov chains, which are mathematical models that describe a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the preceding event. In the context of text generation, a Markov chain can be used to model the likelihood of transitioning from one word to another based on the words that precede it in a given text.

The generator constructs a Markov chain by recording the frequency of word transitions. For example, if the word "cat" frequently follows the word "the" in the input text, the generator assigns a higher probability to that transition in the Markov chain.

To generate a sentence, the generator starts with an initial word (often randomly selected) and uses the Markov chain to probabilistically select the next word based on the preceding word. This process continues until a predetermined stopping condition is met, such as reaching a maximum sentence length or encountering an end-of-sentence marker.
